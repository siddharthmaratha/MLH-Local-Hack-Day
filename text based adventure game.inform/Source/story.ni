"Text-Based Adventure" by Siddharth Maratha

Julianna's Bedroom is a room. The description is "The white walls of the room are matched by the color of the furniture. A rack of shoes sits neatly in one corner and the dresser and bedside table are clear of dust.".
A book is in Julianna's Bedroom. "There is a book lying in the center of the bed."
The Living Room is a room. The description is "This is a small room with a couch in the middle. On one wall there is a bookshelf.".
The Living Room is east of Julianna's Bedroom.
A bookshelf is a container in the Living Room.
Every turn: if the book is in the bookshelf, end the story.
