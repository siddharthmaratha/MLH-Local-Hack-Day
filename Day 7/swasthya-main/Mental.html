                Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional
                well-being. It is all about how people think, feel, and behave.
                People sometimes use the term “mental health” to mean the absence of
                a mental disorder. The WHO stress that mental health is “more than
                just the absence of mental disorders or disabilities.” Peak mental
                health is about not only avoiding active conditions but also looking
                after ongoing wellness and happiness.
