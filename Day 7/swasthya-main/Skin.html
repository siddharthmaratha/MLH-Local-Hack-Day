            Skin disorders vary greatly in symptoms and severity.
            They can be temporary or permanent, and may cause pain or can be painless.
            Some have situational causes, while others may be genetic.
            Some skin conditions are minor, and others can be fatal.
            While most skin disorders are minor, others can indicate a more
            serious issue. Contact your doctor if you think you might have one of these
            common skin problems.<br> <br>Few Examples are given below:

            Hives, also known as urticaria, are itchy, raised welts that are found on the skin.
            They are usually red, pink, or flesh-colored, and sometimes they sting or hurt.
            In most cases, hives are caused by an allergic reaction to a medication or food
            or a reaction to an irritant in the environment. Most rashes go away on their own
            while in the other cases can be treated by proper medications.<br>

            Rubeola (measles) is an infection caused by a virus that grows in the cells
            lining the throat and lungs. It’s a very contagious disease that spreads
            through the air whenever someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. People
            who catch the measles develop symptoms such as a fever, cough, and runny nose.
            A telltale rash is the hallmark of the disease. If measles isn’t treated, it
            can lead to complications such as ear infection, pneumonia, and encephalitis
            (inflammation of the brain).<br>
            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Symptoms include fever, sore throat, red, watery eyes, loss of appetite, cough, and runny nose.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Red rash spreads from the face down the body three to five days after first symptoms appear.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tiny red spots with blue-white centers appear inside the mouth
