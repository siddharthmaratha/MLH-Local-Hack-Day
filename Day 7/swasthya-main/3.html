            Lorena Bola単os was born with a large congenital nevus, a mole that covers a large portion of her body. As a child, classmates made fun of her and adults thought it was an illness that could make other people sick.

Bola単os had a photo shoot as part of Underneath We Are Women, a project that showcases women of all body types.

"My objective is that everybody needs to understand that self-acceptance is the first step to achieve happiness," Bola単os told BuzzFeed News
