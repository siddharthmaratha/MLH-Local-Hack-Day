            Miles Scott stole everyone's heart as a 5-year-old leukemia patient 
            who took over San Francisco in 2013 as Batkid after he told the  
            Make-A-Wish Foundation that he wanted to be Batman. People crowded the 
            streets to cheer him on after San Francisco was turned into Gotham for 
            a day with the help of late mayor Ed Lee and 20,000 volunteers. 
            This year, the foundation announced that Miles, now 10, 
            has been in remission for five years. This is an important
             milestone when many people can be considered as likely to be cancer-free.
